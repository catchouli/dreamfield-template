# dreamfield-template
A template I made for using the ps1-style rendering engine I made for dreamfield. This project pulls in the library components from the dreamfield repository (linked below) and includes some basic assets and game logic from dreamfield to produce a minimal template.

See https://github.com/catchouli/dreamfield for more information.
